# Web-development
This repository contains my mini-projects and practise coding sessions of web development.
These projects and sessions includes:
1. Constructing an IOS web-based calculator, 
2. Practising parallex scrolling, 
3. Adding animations from codepen and 
4. Building a newspaper.
The code might be lenghty but is very basic and simple, easily understandable by a beginner.
